Hey there!
You may be wondering where all the command modules or 'cogs' are,
well, Charfred is pretty barebones out of the box.

This directory is where any command modules should go,
but you'll have to get some first.

There's a bunch of mostly Minecraft server administration related
ones available here: <link here>
if you wanna have something to start off with.

Otherwise you'll probably have to write your own ones!
(hopefully I'll have some documentation for that eventually)
