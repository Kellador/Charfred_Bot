Hey there!
You may be wondering where all the command modules or 'cogs' are,
well, Charfred is pretty barebones out of the box.

Once you have found some cogs, you should create a new directory
on the same level as this readme and place your cogs inside.
Feel free to sort them into further subdirectories as you feel
necessary.

Once placed you will be able to load them using the "cogs" commands
found in the "gearbox" admin-cog.

There's a bunch of mostly Minecraft server administration related
ones available here: <link here>
if you wanna have something to start off with.

Otherwise you'll probably have to write your own ones!
(hopefully I'll have some documentation for that eventually)
