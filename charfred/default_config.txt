# Charfred Configuration Options
# ==============================

# with these nifty configuration options.

# Live-Mode toggle; Setting this to False lets Charfred use
# the stageBotToken instead of the regular one.

# Tokens for Live- and Staging-Environment useage;
# This way you can, for example, register Charfred under two
# seperate BotUsers in Discord and invite one to join your
# Live-Environment, and the other to join a private test group.

# Name of the target SSH-Server;
# This can be an IP adress, or if you have the server details
# saved in your .ssh/config, then you can use that name;
# For example: 'user@myServer', or just 'myServer', if your
# .ssh/config already defines a user for myServer.

# Password for your SSH Login;
# If you have set up pubkey authentication (without key passphrase)
# with your target server, then you can ommit this.

# then that goes in here.
# If you do not have pubkey auth set up, then just put your users
# password in here, if you're comfortable with that.
